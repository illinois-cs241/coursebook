\section{Crash course introduction to C}

The canonical way to start learning C is by starting with the \gls{hello world} program.
The original example that Kernighan and Ritchie proposed way back when hasn't changed.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \keyword{\#include} directive takes the file \keyword{stdio.h} (which stands for \textbf{st}an\textbf{d}ard \textbf{i}nput and \textbf{o}utput) located somewhere in your operating system, copies the text, and substitutes it where the \keyword{\#include} was.
	\item The \keyword{int main(void)} is a function declaration.
    The first word \keyword{int} tells the compiler the return type of the function.
    The part before the parenthesis (\keyword{main}) is the function name.
    In C, no two functions can have the same name in a single compiled program, although shared libraries may be able.
    Then, the parameter list comes after.
    When we provide the parameter list for regular functions \keyword{(void)} that means that the compiler should produce an error if the function is called with a non-zero number of arguments.
    For regular functions having a declaration like \keyword{void func()} means that you are allowed to call the function in a manner similar to \keyword{func(1, 2, 3)}, because there is no delimiter.
    \keyword{main} is a special function.
    There are many ways of declaring \keyword{main} but the ones that you will likely be familiar with are \keyword{int main(void)}, \keyword{int main()}, and \keyword{int main(int argc, char *argv[])}.
	\item \keyword{printf("Hello World\n");} is what we call a function call.
    \keyword{printf} is defined as a part of \keyword{stdio.h}.
    The function has been compiled and lives somewhere else on our machine - the location of the C standard library.
    Just remember to include the header and call the function with the appropriate parameters (a string literal \keyword{"Hello World\n"}).
    If the newline isn't included, the buffer will not be flushed (i.e. the write will not complete immediately).
	\item \keyword{return 0}.
    \keyword{main} has to return an integer.
    By convention, \keyword{return 0} means success and anything else means failure.
    Here are some exit codes / statuses with special meaning: \link{http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html}.
    In general though, assume 0 means success.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ gcc main.c -o main
$ ./main
Hello World
$
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \keyword{gcc} is short for the \gls{GNU Compiler Collection} which has a host of compilers ready for use.
  The compiler infers from the extension that you are trying to compile a .c file.
\item \keyword{./main} tells your shell to execute the program in the current directory called main.
  The program then prints out "hello world".
\end{enumerate}

If systems programming was as easy as writing hello world though, our jobs would be much easier.

\subsection{Preprocessor}

What is the \gls{preprocessor}?
Preprocessing is a copy and paste operation that the compiler performs \textbf{before} actually compiling the program.
The following is an example of substitution

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// Before preprocessing
#define MAX_LENGTH 10
char buffer[MAX_LENGTH]

// After preprocessing
char buffer[10]
\end{lstlisting}

There are side effects to the preprocessor though.
One problem is that the preprocessor needs to be able to \gls{tokenize} properly, meaning trying to redefine the internals of the C language with a preprocessor may be impossible.
Another problem is that they can't be \gls{nested} infinitely - there is a bounded depth where they need to stop.
Macros are also just simple text substitutions, without semantics.
For example, look at what can happen if a macro tries to perform an inline modification.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#define min(a,b) a < b ? a : b
int main() {
  int x = 4;
  if(min(x++, 5)) printf("%d is six", x);
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Macros are simple text substitution so the above example expands to

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
  x++ < 100 ? x++ : 100
\end{lstlisting}

In this case, it is opaque what gets printed out, but it will be 6.
Can you try to figure out why?
Also, consider the edge case when \gls{operator precedence} comes into play.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int x = 99;
int r = 10 + min(99, 100); // r is 100!
// This is what it is expanded to
int r = 10 + 99 < 100 ? 99 : 100
// Which means
int r = (10 + 99) < 100 ? 99 : 100
\end{lstlisting}

You can also have logical problems with the flexibility of certain parameters.
One common source of confusion is with static arrays and the \keyword{sizeof} operator.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#define ARRAY_LENGTH(A) (sizeof((A)) / sizeof((A)[0]))
int static_array[10]; // ARRAY_LENGTH(static_array) = 10
int* dynamic_array = malloc(10); // ARRAY_LENGTH(dynamic_array) = 2 or 1 consistently
\end{lstlisting}

What is wrong with the macro?
Well, it works if a \gls{static array} is passed in because \keyword{sizeof} a static array returns the number of bytes that array takes up, and dividing it by the \keyword{sizeof(an\_element)} would give you the number of entries.
But if passed a pointer to a piece of memory, taking the sizeof the pointer and dividing it by the size of the first entry won't always give us the size of the array.

\subsection{Extra: Includes and conditionals}

The other preprocessor include is the \keyword{\#include} directive and conditionals.
The include directive is explained by example.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// foo.h
int bar();
\end{lstlisting}

This is our file \keyword{bar.c} unpreprocessed.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include "foo.h"
int bar() {
}
\end{lstlisting}

After preprocessing, the compiler sees this

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// foo.c unpreprocessed
int bar();

int bar() {

}
\end{lstlisting}

The other tool is \gls{preprocessor conditionals}.
If a macro is defined or equal to zeros, that branch is not taken.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main() {
  #ifdef __GNUC__
  return 1;
  #else
  return 0;
  #endif
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using \keyword{gcc} your compiler would preprocess the source to the following.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main() {
  return 1;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Using \keyword{clang} your compiler would preprocess to this.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
int main() {
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
