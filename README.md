Welcome to the systems programming coursebook!
This repository houses a high-quality, open-source introductory systems programming textbook used by the [CS 241: System Programming](http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/) course at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/)
The book assumes that you have taken a programming language course and are familiar with assembly instructions.
All of the code and instruction will be in C, as it is the de-facto language of the Linux Kernel.

The Coursebook is an aim to standardize and build upon Angrave's [original wikibook experiment](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki).

The most recent version of the coursebook as a single pdf is here: [main.pdf](https://github.com/illinois-cs241/coursebook/blob/pdf_deploy/main.pdf).

## Overview

### Goals

* Improve the quality and rigour of the original wikibook while maintaining openness.
* Improve the factualness by including citations, footnotes, extended reading, and a glossary.
* Have exports in the form of pdf, markdown, and html.
* Automagically build so writers can focus on writing.
